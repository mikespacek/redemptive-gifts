# Vercel Deployment Instructions

If the automatic deployment is still failing, you can try these manual steps:

## Option 1: Redeploy from the Vercel Dashboard

1. Log in to your Vercel account
2. Go to your project dashboard
3. Click on the "Deployments" tab
4. Find the latest deployment and click the three dots menu (...)
5. Select "Redeploy" to trigger a new build with the latest code

## Option 2: Connect Directly to GitHub

1. Log in to your Vercel account
2. Create a new project (or reconfigure the existing one)
3. Connect to your GitHub repository
4. In the build settings:
   - Build Command: `./build.sh`
   - Output Directory: `.next`
   - Install Command: `npm install`
5. Add any necessary environment variables
6. Deploy

## Option 3: Deploy from Local

If you have the Vercel CLI installed:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if you don't have it
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy from your project directory
vercel --prod
```

## Troubleshooting

If you're still having issues:

1. Check the Vercel logs for specific error messages
2. Make sure all environment variables are properly set
3. Try deploying with a simpler configuration first
4. Consider creating a new project from scratch in Vercel

## Important Settings

Make sure these settings are configured in your Vercel project:

- Node.js Version: 18.x or higher
- Framework Preset: Next.js
- Build Command: `./build.sh`
- Output Directory: `.next`
- Install Command: `npm install`
